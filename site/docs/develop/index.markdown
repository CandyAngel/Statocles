title: Develop Statocles Plugins and Apps
---


Statocles is, at its heart, a content management system. As such, it has
a few places to plug in your own functionality with custom Perl code.
You can write simple plugins to respond to events during content
generation or add new functions to your site's templates. You can write
new applications to manage the content differently. You can create
custom document classes to give a content author richer data structures
for specific types of site content. And you can write custom deploy
modules to deploy your site into your production environment.
