                <p>With a new way to quickly build old git versions, this release fixes compatibility
with Git 1.7.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we had to increase our minimum supported version of Git to
1.7.2, in order to get <code>git status --porcelain</code> and orphan branches. Neither of
these are that big of a deal-breaker, so in theory we could support some
slightly older versions of git.</p>

<p>Full changelog below:</p>

            <description><![CDATA[
                <p>A couple fixes and a couple breaking changes in this release:</p>

<p>The biggest fix is that now we check for ignored files or submodule files before
trying to deploy to a Git repository. This should fix a lot of issues with deploying.</p>

<p>All pages now have a <code>last_modified</code> field, which has an appropriate default.
Also, all the default includes are now templates, so you can use template
variables inside them.  This breaks all existing themes, so make sure to
re-bundle your theme with <code>statocles bundle theme</code>.</p>

<p>Some getting started information was added to <a href="/pod/Statocles/Help/Theme.html">the Theme
guide</a>. In short, the best way to make your own
theme is to start from one of the existing themes.</p>

<p>Finally, the static app now works correctly when it is not at the root of the site.</p>

<p>Full changelog below.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[
                <p>Almost ready for the beta announcement now! Only <a href="https://github.com/preaction/Statocles/milestones/beta">a few issues remain before we
can announce beta</a>.</p>

<p>Content is now always processed through the template parser. This lets us have
includes in the content, so we can have widget templates or plugins that generate
related posts for example. This is a new feature, so I'm excited to see what can
be done with it.</p>

<p>There was some cleanup on the URLs we generate: Directories are being preferred
to files, so that the URLs are a bit easier to read. <code>/blog/page-2.html</code> is now
<code>/blog/page/2</code>, and <code>/blog/tag/mytag/page-2.html</code> is now
<code>/blog/tag/mytag/page/2</code></p>

<p>A new help file was added, <a href="/pod/Statocles/Help/Deploy.html">all about deploying
Statocles</a>. As part of that, a lot of defaults were
updated to be more intuitive: The build directory gets automatically created, and the
default build directory is set to <code>.statocles-build</code>.</p>

<p>A bunch of things were fixed for Windows development, along with a nasty
platform difference in <code>strftime()</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>bundle theme</code> command is now actually useful and allows you to specify
where you want the theme to be copied. So now, if you want to customize the
default theme, you can <code>statocles bundle theme default mytheme</code> to copy the
default theme to the <code>mytheme</code> directory.</p>

<p>Full changelog below</p>

            <title>Release v0.034</title>
            <link>http://preaction.github.io/Statocles/blog/2015/01/25/release-v0.034.html</link>

            <description><![CDATA[
                <p>Lots of breaking changes in this release, in our ramp-up to the <a href="https://github.com/preaction/Statocles/milestones/beta">beta
announcement</a>.</p>

<p>The biggest change in this release is the new <a href="/pod/Statocles/Deploy.html">Deploy object</a>.
The deploy object handles deploying the site to a folder or a Git repository. Future
possibilities include rsync or FTP, or any command at all.</p>

<p><em>NOTE:</em> This change breaks your site.yml file, so please read <a href="/pod/Statocles/Help/Setup.html">the setup help
file</a> to fix it.</p>

<p>Some major theme changes were also added, and a new default theme (using <a href="http://getskeleton.com">the
Skeleton CSS library</a>) was added, removing the need for
Bootstrap (too big) from a CDN.</p>

<p>The theme is now always deployed with the site, always taking the <code>/theme</code> URL
path. This allows you to add extra files, CSS, JavaScript, and otherwise, to your
theme.</p>

<p>The template variables were cleaned up to remove a lot of hashrefs and arrayrefs in favor
of methods and objects, giving us some type checking and cleaner template code.</p>

<p>There are now generic <code>data</code> attributes on the Site and App objects so you can add
any random data you want that can then be used in the templates. Expect upcoming
themes to make good use of this feature!</p>

<p>Full changelog continues below.</p>
