                <p>A couple interesting changes this week!</p>

<p>There was a case where two apps could produce pages with the same path. Now, this
produces a warning, and there's an attempt to do the right thing by making pages
generated by apps more important than files simply being copied.</p>

<p>The <code>url_root</code> attribute was moved to the Statocles::App class, so that all
apps have it. This will prevent an app forgetting to add it.  In order to make
this work, some new methods were added to the Statocles::App class to build
URLs and links with the right URL root.</p>

<p>It's now a lot easier to use a default Theme and still get some minor
customizations by specifying one or more include directories. See <a href="/pod/Statocles/Help/Theme.html">the
Statocles Theme guide</a> for more information.</p>

<p>A single Git repository can now have any number of site deploys inside. Just make
sure the path is somewhere in the Git repository's working tree.</p>

<p>With Moo 2 coming out, Moo::Lax is not needed, so we've changed our dependency to
Moo 2.</p>

<p>Full changelog below:</p>

                <p>A slow week, but some needed features:</p>

<p>The LinkCheck plugin now supports an <code>ignore</code> attribute, in case there are
links that aren't managed by Statocles (like having Github project links in a
Github user/organization site).</p>

<p>A new <code>before_build_write</code> event was added to the Site object, so that plugins
can edit pages after the App creates them, and even add pages to the site.</p>

<p>The Site object now has full control over the Markdown object that turns
Markdown into HTML, which lets you use the other attributes of
<a href="http://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Markdown">Text::Markdown</a>, or even use
<a href="http://metacpan.org/pod/Text::MultiMarkdown">Text::MultiMarkdown</a> or any
object that exposes a <code>markdown</code> method.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[
                <p>A slight breaking change in this release: The "last modified" date is no longer being
used in the blog. Instead, the date shown is only the slug date, which makes the date
more accurate when pre-dating posts.</p>

<p>The <code>last_modified</code> attribute is now simply called <code>date</code>, which makes it a bit more
general-purpose. This means that you'll need to re-bundle your templates.</p>

<p>A change to <a href="http://metacpan.org/pod/Beam::Wire">Beam::Wire</a> means a change to Statocles
config files: <code>$method</code> in the event handlers is now <code>$sub</code>, so if you have configured
the LinkCheck plugin, you'll get a deprecation warning from Beam::Wire.</p>

<p>The site creator now allows you to set the <code>base_url</code>, since that's required for
Statocles to work properly. It also, if given a site as an argument, creates the
site's directory.</p>

            <link>http://preaction.github.io/Statocles/blog/2015/03/02/release-v0.040</link>
            <guid>http://preaction.github.io/Statocles/blog/2015/03/02/release-v0.040</guid>
            <description><![CDATA[
                <p>The biggest new thing in this release is the new <a href="/pod/Statocles/Plugin/LinkCheck.html">LinkCheck
plugin</a> that checks all the pages for
broken links and images. This introduces a new event-handling API into
Statocles, which will be called Plugins. See <a href="/pod/Statocles/Help/Develop.html">the developer
docs</a> for more information on plugins.</p>

<p>A bunch of bug fixes for the <code>create</code> command. It now actually works, instead
of creating an unusable <code>site.yml</code> file.</p>

<p>The default build directory is now <code>.statocles/build</code> instead of <code>.statocles-build</code>.
It is anticipated we might use the <code>.statocles</code> directory for some additional
site metadata.</p>

<p>With <a href="http://mojolicio.us">Mojolicious</a> 6.0 release, there were a few breaking
changes that we needed to fix in Statocles. We now require 6.0.</p>

                <p>This is it! The beta milestone is complete!</p>

<p>This release adds the "create" command to easily create new Statocles sites.</p>

<p>Blog posts are now directories, which will allow us (in the future) to have
images and other documents inside. The breaking part of this change was made now,
and future additions will be made as beta progresses.</p>

<p>There were a couple reorganizations of the documentation and tests to make them
easier to understand.</p>
