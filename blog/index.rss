                <p>This is it! The beta milestone is complete!</p>

<p>This release adds the "create" command to easily create new Statocles sites.</p>

<p>Blog posts are now directories, which will allow us (in the future) to have
images and other documents inside. The breaking part of this change was made now,
and future additions will be made as beta progresses.</p>

<p>There were a couple reorganizations of the documentation and tests to make them
easier to understand.</p>

<p>Full changelog below:</p>

                <p>With a new way to quickly build old git versions, this release fixes compatibility
with Git 1.7.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we had to increase our minimum supported version of Git to
1.7.2, in order to get <code>git status --porcelain</code> and orphan branches. Neither of
these are that big of a deal-breaker, so in theory we could support some
slightly older versions of git.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[
                <p>A couple fixes and a couple breaking changes in this release:</p>

<p>The biggest fix is that now we check for ignored files or submodule files before
trying to deploy to a Git repository. This should fix a lot of issues with deploying.</p>

<p>All pages now have a <code>last_modified</code> field, which has an appropriate default.
Also, all the default includes are now templates, so you can use template
variables inside them.  This breaks all existing themes, so make sure to
re-bundle your theme with <code>statocles bundle theme</code>.</p>

<p>Some getting started information was added to <a href="/pod/Statocles/Help/Theme.html">the Theme
guide</a>. In short, the best way to make your own
theme is to start from one of the existing themes.</p>

<p>Finally, the static app now works correctly when it is not at the root of the site.</p>

<p>Full changelog below.</p>

                <p>Almost ready for the beta announcement now! Only <a href="https://github.com/preaction/Statocles/milestones/beta">a few issues remain before we
can announce beta</a>.</p>

<p>Content is now always processed through the template parser. This lets us have
includes in the content, so we can have widget templates or plugins that generate
related posts for example. This is a new feature, so I'm excited to see what can
be done with it.</p>

<p>There was some cleanup on the URLs we generate: Directories are being preferred
to files, so that the URLs are a bit easier to read. <code>/blog/page-2.html</code> is now
<code>/blog/page/2</code>, and <code>/blog/tag/mytag/page-2.html</code> is now
<code>/blog/tag/mytag/page/2</code></p>

<p>A new help file was added, <a href="/pod/Statocles/Help/Deploy.html">all about deploying
Statocles</a>. As part of that, a lot of defaults were
updated to be more intuitive: The build directory gets automatically created, and the
default build directory is set to <code>.statocles-build</code>.</p>

<p>A bunch of things were fixed for Windows development, along with a nasty
platform difference in <code>strftime()</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>bundle theme</code> command is now actually useful and allows you to specify
where you want the theme to be copied. So now, if you want to customize the
default theme, you can <code>statocles bundle theme default mytheme</code> to copy the
default theme to the <code>mytheme</code> directory.</p>
