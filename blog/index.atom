            <p>A couple small changes in this release:</p>

<p>Blog posts are now allowed to have images inside the post directory. This makes
it a lot easier to add images to blogs. You don't need to configure a global
<code>/images</code> directory. You can put your image in <code>/blog/YYYY/MM/DD/post-title</code>.
Even better, you get to refer to it in your post as <code>![](image.jpg)</code>.</p>

<p>The <a href="/pod/Statocles/Plugin/LinkCheck.html">link check plugin</a> now correctly finds
links the URL encoded characters.</p>

<p>The recent posts helper now allows filtering by tag, if, for example, you want to
display only the last <code>release</code> blog and not any other blog post.</p>

<p><code>statocles daemon</code> now allows setting <code>-p &lt;port&gt;</code>, in case port 3000 is in-use, or
you need to run multiple instances.</p>

<p>Full changelog below:</p>

            <p>A few small features, and some small breaking changes in this release.</p>

<p>The <code>read_document</code> and <code>write_document</code> method of
<a href="/pod/Statocles/Store/File.html">Statocles::Store::File</a> now use
<a href="/pod/Statocles/Document.html">Statocles::Document</a> instead of plain hashrefs.
It was weird to have one method (<code>read_documents</code> with an <code>s</code>) get document
objects, and everything else use hashes. The important
serialization/deserialization routines are in Statocles::Document, so it is
likely that more changes will happen around these APIs in the future.</p>

<p>Because of the above change, Stores now have a way to read a document from a string.
So, when a blog post is read from <code>&lt;STDIN&gt;</code>, it can contain tags, links, and other
fields, instead of just content.</p>

<p>Some fixes to blog slugs to remove any non-word characters, and also reduce
every replacement to a single dash (<code>-</code>), instead of having multiple dashes.
This only affects new posts, not existing posts, so if you want to fix your
current posts, you must fix them manually.</p>

<p>An upgrade to <a href="http://metacpan.org/pod/Beam::Wire">Beam::Wire</a> now allows you
to compose roles in the Statocles configuration file, so additional behavior
can be added to existing applications. See <a href="/pod/Statocles/Help/Develop.html">the Develop
Guide</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="/pod/Statocles/App/Blog.html">the Blog app</a> now has a <code>recent_posts()</code>
method that can be used in templates and markdown to display the most recent
posts in a blog.</p>

<p>Full changelog is below.</p>

            <p>A couple interesting changes this week!</p>

<p>There was a case where two apps could produce pages with the same path. Now, this
produces a warning, and there's an attempt to do the right thing by making pages
generated by apps more important than files simply being copied.</p>

<p>The <code>url_root</code> attribute was moved to the Statocles::App class, so that all
apps have it. This will prevent an app forgetting to add it.  In order to make
this work, some new methods were added to the Statocles::App class to build
URLs and links with the right URL root.</p>

<p>It's now a lot easier to use a default Theme and still get some minor
customizations by specifying one or more include directories. See <a href="/pod/Statocles/Help/Theme.html">the
Statocles Theme guide</a> for more information.</p>

<p>A single Git repository can now have any number of site deploys inside. Just make
sure the path is somewhere in the Git repository's working tree.</p>

<p>With Moo 2 coming out, Moo::Lax is not needed, so we've changed our dependency to
Moo 2.</p>

            <p>A slow week, but some needed features:</p>

<p>The LinkCheck plugin now supports an <code>ignore</code> attribute, in case there are
links that aren't managed by Statocles (like having Github project links in a
Github user/organization site).</p>

<p>A new <code>before_build_write</code> event was added to the Site object, so that plugins
can edit pages after the App creates them, and even add pages to the site.</p>

<p>The Site object now has full control over the Markdown object that turns
Markdown into HTML, which lets you use the other attributes of
<a href="http://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Markdown">Text::Markdown</a>, or even use
<a href="http://metacpan.org/pod/Text::MultiMarkdown">Text::MultiMarkdown</a> or any
object that exposes a <code>markdown</code> method.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[
            <p>A slight breaking change in this release: The "last modified" date is no longer being
used in the blog. Instead, the date shown is only the slug date, which makes the date
more accurate when pre-dating posts.</p>

<p>The <code>last_modified</code> attribute is now simply called <code>date</code>, which makes it a bit more
general-purpose. This means that you'll need to re-bundle your templates.</p>

<p>A change to <a href="http://metacpan.org/pod/Beam::Wire">Beam::Wire</a> means a change to Statocles
config files: <code>$method</code> in the event handlers is now <code>$sub</code>, so if you have configured
the LinkCheck plugin, you'll get a deprecation warning from Beam::Wire.</p>

<p>The site creator now allows you to set the <code>base_url</code>, since that's required for
Statocles to work properly. It also, if given a site as an argument, creates the
site's directory.</p>
