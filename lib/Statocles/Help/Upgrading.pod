=item site "index" property should be absolute path to index page (got "%s")

The L<site object|Statocles::Site> "index" property used to be the name of the
application that should be used as the index. For this to work, applications
need to say which of their pages should be the site index, which they did by
putting that page first in the list of pages returned. This was magic, and
prone to breakage. It also doesn't allow the site author to choose any page
they want as the site index.

To fix this, set the site's "index" property to the path to the page you want
to be the index page, including the leading slash.

See the L<docs for the index property of the Site object|Statocles::Site/index>
for more information.

Deprecated in v0.051. Fatal in v1.000. Exception removed in v2.000.

Thanks to L<Kyle Sheely|https://github.com/kylesheely> for the idea.

=item Statocles::Store::File is deprecated

Statocles::Store::File was created in anticipation of making other Store
objects like MongoDB or Hadoop. But, having it merely complicates the API
without actually changing whether other Stores could be created (apparently I
forgot that polymorphism exists).

Since the likelihood of those other Stores is low, and since having only one
Statocles::Store doesn't prevent making a Statocles::Store::MongoDB or
Statocles::Store::Custom class, it's better to remove this complexity before
v1.000

The shim module that remains in place will be removed in v1.000.
